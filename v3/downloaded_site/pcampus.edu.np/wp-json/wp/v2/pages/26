In view of the ever increasing responsibility of civil engineers in relation with the research needs and technological development, in view of the changing need of society, and supported by the long experience of the institute in conducting undergraduate programs, the institute plans to embark on higher level of engineering education. Under the plan of ne expansion in engineering education, the institute, in collaboration with Norwegian University Of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway, has drawn up Master Level Programs in various fields of engineering. In this context, department of Civil engineering of the Pulchowk campus, have started offering the following programs.<\/p>\n<h4>Programs offered<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>BE in Civil engineering &#8211; Established in 1978 AD<\/li>\n<li>M.

CTML was initially set up to meet the requirement of engineering education curriculum. Since 1976, owing to the country\u2019s increasing activity in construction sector, it was decided that CTML should expand its scope of services by facility the testing of buildings and highway materials and catering soil investigation works for the various government and privately owned projects. Since then the CTML has been involved in various government and privately owned projects covering a wide variety of civil engineering project, such as airports, hydro power, highways, irrigation, factories and buildings. This service is ongoing and the CTML through the years has gained an excellent reputation in the construction industry in Nepal.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1278\" height=\"734\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-256\" title=\"Central Material Testing Laboratory \" src=\"http:\/\/pcampus.edu.np\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/BSC1741.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pcampus.edu.np\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/BSC1741.jpg 1278w, https:\/\/pcampus.edu.np\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/BSC1741-300x172.jpg 300w, https:\/\/pcampus.edu.np\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/BSC1741-1024x588.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/pcampus.edu.np\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/BSC1741-600x345.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1278px) 100vw, 1278px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Laboratory facilities &amp; services<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The laboratory mainly consists of the Geotechnical section, the Building Material Section and Highway material Section.
