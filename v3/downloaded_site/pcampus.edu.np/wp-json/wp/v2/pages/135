It should consist of an introduction, topic definition, purpose of research, the importance of research and research originality, research problem and research questions, a short literature review to indicate the validity of research purpose and research questions and state of research works on the issue at local, regional and global levels, the hypothesis of problem solutions if any, proposed methodology\/field and laboratory needs, synopsis\/state of research if already embarked upon, expected output in terms of discoveries, theories or interpretations and or possibilities, references, and bibliography. A calendar of activities that need to be undertaken so as to achieve the research proposal (spread over about two and half years) shall also be included. The research proposal shall be presented in about 2000 words.<\/li>\n<li>A portfolio of works, a list of published and unpublished research reports with synopsis copies of not more than three of such published\/unpublished research articles, research reports that give an idea of research achievement of the past or are otherwise felt as important contributions. At least one research article published in national\/international journals or, graduate conferences or, national\/international conferences is a must. The candidate should be the first author for the eligibility of the article. The articles or editorials published in the local newspaper will not be entertained.<\/li>\n<li>Two letters of recommendation from referees, one of which shall be preferably from academic faculty from the previous institutions.

If the proposed research area of the students fit into the broad topical framework of research identified for the concerned department under their research inter-linkage programs and have a strong national relevance, the chances of acceptance for admission would be better. Prospective students are encouraged to consult with faculty members and potential research supervisors prior to submitting applications.<\/p>\n<p>Application documents, publications, presentations, and preliminary research proposals will be reviewed by the respective Departmental Research Committee (DRC). The DRC would appoint subject specialists from within IOE or other co-operating academic institutions, to review and evaluate publications and preliminary research proposal and make necessary recommendations on them. Applicants with research proposals not recommended for admission by two subject specialist(s) will be excluded from further processing. The DRC will review other documents along with the specialist recommendations and interview the candidates under the general guidelines and standards for review and evaluation of applications as approved by the Institute of Engineering Research Committee (IERC).<\/p>\n<p>The scrutiny and evaluation of the application will be based on past academic performance, research publications, the relevance of proposed research and the results of the interview and DRC will make recommendations to IERC for admission or otherwise. IERC may direct DRC, from time to time and through specific regulations, to review existing criteria.<\/p>\n<p>IERC has the formal authority to accept students for doctoral studies. The accepted applicants will be offered admission to the related Departments in Pulchowk. Campus.
