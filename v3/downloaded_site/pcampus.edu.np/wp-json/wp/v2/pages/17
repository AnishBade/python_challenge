The Institute of engineering is one of the Institutes of Tribhuvan University. Under the Institute of Engineering, there are four constituent campuses and ten private colleges. Pulchowk Campus is the central campus of the Institute of Engineering. It was established in 1972 (2029 B.S) as one of the constituent campuses of the Institute of Engineering and is situated at the heart of the Lalitpur city at Pulchowk. Initially, it was started for the production of trade-level manpower to fulfill the nation\u2019s need in the field of Engineering. Pulchowk campus offered diploma level (intermediate level with three years duration) courses in various engineering disciplines since 1973 (2030 BS) but diploma level courses are phased out now. Pulchowk campus has been offering bachelor\u2019s degree courses in various engineering disciplines since 1984 (2041 BS).<\/p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 16.9pt; widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 0in 0in 0.25in; text-align: justify;\">Till 1984 Pulchowk Campus was involved in producing low to middle-level engineering manpower in the field of Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronics Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Architecture. Realizing the national and global demand gradually the country felt a need for engineering manpower at a higher level. As a result, four years of bachelor level course in Civil Engineering was introduced in 1984. Gradually, bachelors in Electrical Engineering and bachelor in Electronics Engineering started from 1994 (2051 BS), bachelors in Mechanical Engineering and Architecture started from 1995 (2052 BS) and bachelors in Computer Engineering started from 1998 (2055 BS). All these Bachelors in Engineering (BE) programs were introduced for the first time in Nepal.<\/p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 16.9pt; widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 0in 0in 0.25in; text-align: justify;\">Currently, Pulchowk Campus offers bachelor&#8217;s level, master&#8217;s level, and Ph.D. level programs in different areas of engineering.
